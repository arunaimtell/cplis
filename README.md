### Tests

The tests use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck). You don't
need to install anything. They run in a container. 

```console
$ make test
```

### Using the `Makefile`

```console
$ make help
cf-apply                      Run terraform apply for Amazon.
cf-destroy                    Run terraform destroy for Amazon.
cf-plan                       Run terraform plan for Amazon.
shellcheck                     Runs the shellcheck tests on the scripts.
test                           Runs the tests on the repository.
update-terraform               Update terraform binary locally from the docker container.
update                         Update terraform binary locally.
```
